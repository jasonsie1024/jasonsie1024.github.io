When it comes to booking travel, convenience is key. That's why online travel agencies like Expedia have become popular for travelers who want to bundle flights, hotels, and activities in one booking. But after my recent experience, I’ve come to one conclusion: never again.

# A Personal Experience Gone Wrong

I booked a round-trip package to Busan through Expedia. All was well until, just days before my flight, Jin Air canceled the outbound leg due to an approaching typhoon. Understandably, weather issues can disrupt flights, but the ordeal that followed with Expedia’s so-called “customer support” left me wondering how a company this large can get away with such terrible service.

As soon as I saw the cancellation notice on Jin Air’s website, I reached out to Expedia’s online support, assuming they would help me rebook or at least confirm the situation. Instead, the support agent insisted they couldn’t confirm the cancellation — even though the information was visible on the airline’s official website. It was as if Expedia’s system couldn’t connect with reality, leaving me with no recourse but to handle everything on my own.

# A Lack of Real Support

After being forced to arrange alternative travel myself, I tried to follow up with Expedia for some form of resolution when I returned. I was met with the same unhelpful script each time I called. I was told they needed to contact the airline, which involved long waits on hold. Five minutes later, they would return with a tired, unhelpful reply: they couldn’t get in touch with the airline, and therefore, they couldn’t confirm the cancellation or offer any assistance.

The entire experience was a painful loop of delays and deflections, showing just how little investment Expedia has made in ensuring customers receive meaningful support. It’s as though their system was designed to keep customers in limbo rather than to provide actual solutions.

# Where Expedia Fails Its Customers

Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering Expedia for your travel needs:

- Lack of Real-Time Support: In the travel industry, situations can change rapidly, and travelers need support they can rely on. Expedia’s inability to confirm a flight cancellation that was clearly indicated on the airline’s website demonstrates a serious flaw in their operations.
- Scripted Customer Service: No matter how many times I contacted their support, the agents appeared to be working from the same unhelpful script. This “support” approach leaves customers stranded and frustrated.
- System Inefficiency: Despite being a large platform, Expedia seemed incapable of accessing the necessary channels to confirm the most basic information with the airline. It’s astonishing that their technology can’t facilitate a simple confirmation, leaving customers caught in endless cycles of phone calls.
- Lack of Accountability: At no point did anyone from Expedia take responsibility for the situation or show any initiative to resolve it. They consistently placed the burden on me, their customer, to navigate the problem on my own.

# The Final Verdict: Avoid Expedia

Expedia’s ease of use might draw you in, but if my experience is anything to go by, you could be sacrificing reliable support in times of need. My advice? Don’t risk your trip. Expedia may seem convenient, but if there’s any issue with your booking, you may find yourself stranded with minimal help.
