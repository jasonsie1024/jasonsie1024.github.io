# TL;DR
* Basis Arbitrage is:
    - Low risk arbitrage between Spot and Coin-Margin Delivery.
    - Creating a price-neutral hedging position and hold to basis convergence. 
    - Not totally risk-free since systematic risk (e.g. CEX) still applies.
    - Getting the risk-adjusted return of the crypto market.

# Prerequisite

* Spot - Holding / Trading the underlying asset
    - eg. Gold / Stock Units / BTC.
    - Create a long position and exposure when holding spot.
* Delivery - Future contract that trades underlying assets and settles on a given date
    - eg. BTC on 2025-03-28
    - Coin-Margin means the underlying asset is also used as margin to maintain position.
    - Can create a long or short position with or with out leverages.
